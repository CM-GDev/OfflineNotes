# JATE - OfflineNotes

  ## Description
  
  - This is my first progressive web application, PWA. It's a single-page text editor/note taker app that runs in the browser. It features a number of data persistence techniques that serve as redundancy in case one of the options is not supported by the browser. The app can be downloaded and function offline!
  - To build the application, I started with an existing non-PWA application and implemented methods for getting and storing data to an IndexedDB database.
    
    
  The following is a screenshot of the downloaded application.
